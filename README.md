## yeet

a golang program that reads a file with job application details to help me review and share information about jobs that I apply to

## Getting Started
```sh
git clone https://github.com/1NF053C/yeet.git
# edit `submitted_applications.yaml` to add details about additional jobs applied to
go run . process

# edit yeet_test.go to design additions for yeet.go
```

## Tests

./autotest.sh
# now save any changes to test or source files and tests will automatically rerun
```
